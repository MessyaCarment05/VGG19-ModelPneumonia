# VGG19-ModelPneumonia
## Overview

This repository contains the code for detecting indicators of pneumonia in chest X-ray images using a VGG-19 model. Pneumonia remains a significant health concern worldwide, necessitating timely and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods may be time-consuming and subject to human error, highlighting the need for automated approaches in medical imaging.

To tackle this issue, the study utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection. The VGG-19 model is employed for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks, allowing for precise identification of pneumonia indicators.

## The code in this repository includes:

- Data preprocessing of chest X-ray images for model input.
- Implementation of the VGG-19 model for pneumonia detection.
- Training and evaluation of the model to assess its accuracy and reliability.
